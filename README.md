 **Note:** `./data/` is not git managed (files are too big). If files are downloaded from Google Drive and split into multiple zips, do the following:
  
- Put the zips in a folder called `data-zips`.
- Create another folder inside `data-zips` called `combo`.
- Open a terminal and `cd` into `data-zips`.
- Run `unzip '*.zip' -d combined`
- All zips will have been extracted and combined inside the `combined` folder.
- Copy the contents from `combined` to `./data/`
